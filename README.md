# Project Descriptions

## Fibonacci Sequence
This code generates numbers in the fibonacci sequence. It produces a vertical list with the desired values. It does this using recursion.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
This code allows two users to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against each other. It deduces a winner based on the user's selelctions of rock, paper or scissors, which each have their own value. The values are then subtracted, and the results are used to determine a winner. Then the program will ask if the players want to play again.

## Random Passowrd Generator
This code develops a random password based on the user's input of a base phrase and of their desired length of the password. It creates a password by randomly taking from all of the different types of text. A final password is then presented with the desired length and base phrase.
